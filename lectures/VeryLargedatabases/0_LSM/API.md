Application Programming Interface is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other by exchanging data and functionality. It acts as an intermediary that takes a request from one application and delivers it to another, returning the response to the original application. This allows developers to use existing services without having to build them from scratch, making development faster and more efficient.

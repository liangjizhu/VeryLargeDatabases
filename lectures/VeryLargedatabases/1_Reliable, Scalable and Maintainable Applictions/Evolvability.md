Making change easy
- [[SQL Databases]] assume a [[Schemas]] - may be changed with [[ALTER TABLE]]
- [[Schema-On-Read]] databases don't enforce a [[Schemas]] - A database may contain older and newer formats
- [[Service-Side Applications]] - Rolling upgrades
- [[Client-Side Applications]] - At the mercy of the user who may not upgrade for some time ?
- ![[Backward Compatibility]]
- ![[Forward Compatibility]]

Database models that relax the strict [[First Normal Form (1NF)]] of traditional relational databases, allowing complex, hierarchical data structures where attribute values can themselves be entire tables (relations) or complex objects, enabling direct representation of real-world entities like a person with multiple phone numbers or a department with a list of employees in a single record, often called [[Non-First-Normal-Form (NF2)]] databases, to handle complexity without excessive joins.

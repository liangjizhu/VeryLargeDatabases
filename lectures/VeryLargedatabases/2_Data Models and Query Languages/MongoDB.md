A popular, **open-source** [[NoSQL]] document database that stores data in flexible, [[JSON]]-like documents called [[BSON]]. It is known for its high performance, [[scalability]] and flexibility, which make it a good choice for modern applications that need to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to iterate quickly, and its ability to scale horizontally helps manage growing data loads.

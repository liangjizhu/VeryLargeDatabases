A programming technique and tool that creates a bridge between object-oriented programming languages (like Python, Java) and relational databases (like [[SQL]]), allowing developers to interact with database data as if they were working with objects in their code, without writing raw [[SQL]], simplifying data management, and increasing productivity by handling the translation between the two worlds.

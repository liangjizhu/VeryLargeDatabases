- The standard database method
- [[Height-Balanced]] tree with blocks as nodes
- All "user records" are at leaf level ("bottom")
- Typical height: 2, 3, 4
- Minimum 50% filldegree in blocks
- Average 67% filldegree in blocks
- Records are sorted on the key, and the tree supports:
	- Direct search on key
	- Range search
	- Sequential, sorted scans
	- Good for most uses, except heavy write (insert) load

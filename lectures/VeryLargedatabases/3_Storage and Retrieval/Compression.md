Reduces data size by finding patterns, removing redundancy, and reorganising data, leading to significant storage savings, faster data retrieval (fewer pages to read), and lower costs, using techniques like [[Run-Length Encoding]], [[Dictionary Encoding]], and [[Columnar Compression]] to achieve this efficiently, often losslessly. It's crucial for managing large datasets, improving I/O, and optimising resource usage in modern databases.

- The basic function of a database is to **store** data and later you could **retrieve** it
- Basic storage + indexes ([[Heap File]] + index)
- To speed up retrieval -> indexing
- Indexes speed up queries, but slow down writes
- Thus, the application developer or the database administrator choose which indexes to be created based on the application and [[query]] pattern

A data [[Compression]] method, especially useful for columns with repeated values (low [[Cardinality]]), that replaces actual data entries with smaller integer codes (indices) pointing to a unique list (dictionary) of all distinct values, drastically cutting storage space and speeding up analytical queries by working with integers instead of strings or large data types. It works by creating a unique value list (dictionary) and then storing a sequence of indices referencing that list for the original data.

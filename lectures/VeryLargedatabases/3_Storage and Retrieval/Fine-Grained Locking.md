A concurrency control technique that uses many small locks to protect individual data elements or small sections of data, rather than one large lock for an entire structure, allowing more threads to work concurrently on different parts of the data, which boosts parallelism but increases complexity and overhead. It contrasts with [[Coarse-Grained Locking]], which uses fewer, larger locks, simplifying code but causing more contention.

A data structure that stores data in [[key-value pairs]], allowing for fast retrieval of values using their unique keys, much like a dictionary where you look up a word (key) to find its definition (value). It uses a hash function to convert a key into an array index (a "bucket"), providing near-instantaneous (constant-time) average performance for adding, finding or deleting elements.

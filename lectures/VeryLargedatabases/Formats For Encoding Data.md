- In memory, data is kept in objects, structs, lists, arrays, hash tables, trees... Use pointers
- When writing to a file or sending it over the network: Self-Contained sequence of bytes. No direct pointers.
- [[Encoding]]/[[Decoding]], [[Marshalling]]/[[Unmarshalling]], [[Serialization]]/[[Deserialization]]: Sending and receiving data
- Built-in language support:
	- [[Java]] has [[java.io.Serializable]]
	- [[Ruby]] has [[Marshal]]
	- [[Python]] has [[Pickle]]
- Tied to a particular programming language
- [[Decoding]] may cause security problems due to arbitrary code has to be installed. (Example: Instantiate a class in the class path)
- [[Versioning]] ?
- Performance ?
